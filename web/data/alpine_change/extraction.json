      "text": "particularly for detecting complex land-use changes and vegetation phenological patterns [22]. By\nleveraging our multi-temporal HabitAlp dataset with documented changes between 2003, 2013, and\n2020, we are able to evaluate and compare these different architectural paradigms in a real-world\noperational context, aligning with the growing call in the community to move beyond pure accuracy\nmetrics towards more holistic, impact-driven assessments of model reliability for specific applications\nlike conservation management [35].\nIn conclusion, there is a considerable body of research out there evolving fast with many GFM\nstudies demonstrating strong capability on land-cover and semantic segmentation tasks. However, as\nof October 2025, there are very limited peer-reviewed studies that focus on fine ecological habitat\ntypes used in conservation practice and the use of GFMs end-to-end is still sparse. We therefore\nbelieve our study to show the currently achievable level of accuracy for multiple fine ecological classes\nand to point the direction of improvements needed for a more operational implementation.\n3\nMethodology\n3.1\nStudy site and Datasets\nThe study area, shown in Fig. 1, encompasses the Gesäuse National Park in Styria, Austria,\nincluding the national park itself, the Natura 2000 protected area Ennstaler Alpen/Gesäuse and\nthe Johnsbachtal catchment, located south of the protected site. This area is also a site in the\nEuropean Long-Term Ecosystem Research (eLTER) network [36]. The region features extensive\nforests, dynamic waterways, alpine meadows, and rocky landscapes [37]. Forest management is\ngenerally limited to necessary safety logging around infrastructure and some assisted transformation\nto a more natural tree species composition by removing formerly planted spruces. Approximately\n70% of the forest within the national park is protected biotope forest, where natural processes,\nsuch as bark beetle infestations, are allowed to proceed without human intervention [38]. These\nmanagement regulations enable the occurrence of rare ecological dynamics not commonly found in\nother areas of Austria.\nFigure 1: Map of the study area\n6\n",

Furthermore, we derived terrain parameters from\nthe LiDAR data, including slope, aspect, and terrain roughness [40].\nAll geospatial data use the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Coordinate System, zone 33N\n(EPSG:32633). The temporal availability of these datasets is summarized in Table 1.\n3.1.2\nReference Data\nThe ground truth labels are derived from the HabitAlp dataset, covering the Gesäuse National\nPark and the Natura 2000 area, totaling approximately 154 km². The mapped attributes include\necological habitat types, natural processes, tree species composition, deadwood occurrence, and other\necological indicators. This dataset is comprised of 30,241 polygons mapped by aerial photo stereo\ninterpretation for the years 1954, 2003, and 2013 by Hoffert and Anfang (2006) [41] and Hauenstein\nand Indra-Camathias (2018) [42].\nThe original habitat classification scheme comprising 115 classes was reclassified into 23 classes to\noptimize class balance and emphasize forest structural diversity for subsequent analysis, see Table 2.\nBetween 2003 and 2013, 4,480 polygons—covering 15.3 km²—exhibited detected changes. Change\ntransitions between the 23 classes were further aggregated into 8 generalized transition categories\nfor multi-class CD, see Table 3. Since CIR and elevation data are not available for 2003, four areas\nwithin the national park were additionally mapped for 2020 following the 23-class scheme to support\nthe training & evaluation of the direct CD approach.\n7\n",

In this context, the validation set is\nused within the training process to assess and adapt model performance, while the test set is left\nout in the whole training set up as an in-domain evaluation data set to calculate metrics such as\noverall accuracy (OA) and intersection over union (IoU). This spatial split helps ensure that the\ntest and validation data are geographically independent from the training data, reducing spatial\nautocorrelation and potential data leakage.\n3.2\nExperimental Framework\nTo systematically evaluate AI-driven approaches for alpine habitat monitoring, we designed a\ncomprehensive experimental framework that directly addresses our core research questions through\nrigorous comparison of CD paradigms under real-world data constraints. Our framework centers\non evaluating two fundamental approaches: post-classification CD (Approach 1) and direct CD\n(Approach 2), both visualized in Fig. 2.\n8\n",

U-Net\ndirect change detection achieved 52% binary accuracy, comparable to ChangeViT’s 50%. Clay’s 11\npercentage-point drop from in-domain performance to cross-temporal performance (see Tables 5\nand 6) was comparable to Prithvi’s 9-point drop, while U-Net post-classification showed the largest\ndegradation at 18 points (from 67% to 49%). U-Net direct change showed a slight improvement from\n48% to 52%, while ChangeViT maintained 50% binary accuracy across both test sets. All results are\nshown in Table 6.\nFor multi-class change detection on the 2020 dataset, all models experienced severe performance\ndegradation compared to the binary CD results. Prithvi achieved the highest multi-class overall\naccuracy at 37%, followed by Clay 1.0 at 33% and U-Net at 23%. However, Clay maintained the\nhighest macro IoU at 0.14 compared to Prithvi’s 0.12 and U-Net post-classification’s 0.05. U-Net\ndirect change detection produced multi-class results on the 2020 dataset (20% accuracy, 0.1 IoU),\nshowing slightly lower performance compared to the 2003-2013 results (28% accuracy, 0.19 IoU).\n14\n",

As shown in Table 7, the post-classification approach (Clay v1.0) achieves higher\nIoU scores across most transition classes than the direct change detection method. It seems that\nperformance is correlated with the frequency/occurrence area of each transition class. The highest\nscore is unsurprisingly achieved within the “No Change” class, comprising 90.9 percent coverage of\nthe total area. Only “Mature forest with canopy cover loss” and “Clearcut” surpass an IoU of 0.2,\nwhile all other rare transitions yield much lower scores. The U-Net-based change detection approach\nyields higher scores than Clay for four classes, including “No Change”.\n15\n",

Table 8\ndemonstrates the substantial contribution of elevation data to habitat classification performance.\nThe addition of nDSM to RGB and NIR inputs improved semantic segmentation accuracy by 9%,\nfrom 31% to 40%, representing a 29% relative improvement. Further incorporation of LiDAR-derived\nterrain attributes yielded the best performance at 50% accuracy with 0.31 macro IoU.\nFor change detection tasks, the impact of multimodal data was limited. Binary change detection\naccuracy remained at 41% with NIR addition, increased to 44% with nDSM inclusion, and returned\nto 41% with full LiDAR attributes. The maximum improvement of 3 percentage points (RGB\nto RGB+NIR+nDSM) contrasts sharply with the 19 percentage-point gain observed for semantic\nsegmentation tasks.\nTable 8: Results of multimodal data impact assessment using the U-Net post-classification and direct\nCD approach\nChange Metrics 2003-2013\nSemantic Segmentation Metrics 2013\nModalities\nOverall\nMacro\nMacro\nOverall\nMacro\nMacro\nAccuracy (%)\nIoU\nF1-Score Accuracy (%)\nIoU\nF1-Score\nRGB\n0.41\n0.13\n0.21\n0.3\n0.16\n0.26\nRGB + NIR\n0.41\n0.14\n0.22\n0.31\n0.17\n0.27\nRGB + NIR + nDSM\n0.44\n0.14\n0.22\n0.40\n0.24\n0.37\nRGB + NIR + LiDAR\n0.41\n0.14\n0.22\n0.5\n0.31\n0.45\n5\nDiscussion\nOur results demonstrate that foundation models, particularly Clay 1.0, offer consistent but modest\nperformance advantages over traditional CNN architectures for multi-class change detection in\nAlpine habitat monitoring. These findings align with literature showing that GFMs such as Prithvi\nand Clay achieve robust results in settings with limited training data by leveraging self-supervised\npre-training on large, temporally diverse datasets [5, 22].
