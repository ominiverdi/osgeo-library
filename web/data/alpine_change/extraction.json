By\nleveraging our multi-temporal HabitAlp dataset with documented changes between 2003, 2013, and\n2020, we are able to evaluate and compare these different architectural paradigms in a real-world\noperational context, aligning with the growing call in the community to move beyond pure accuracy\nmetrics towards more holistic, impact-driven assessments of model reliability for specific applications\nlike conservation management [35].\nIn conclusion, there is a considerable body of research out there evolving fast with many GFM\nstudies demonstrating strong capability on land-cover and semantic segmentation tasks. However, as\nof October 2025, there are very limited peer-reviewed studies that focus on fine ecological habitat\ntypes used in conservation practice and the use of GFMs end-to-end is still sparse. We therefore\nbelieve our study to show the currently achievable level of accuracy for multiple fine ecological classes\nand to point the direction of improvements needed for a more operational implementation.\n3\nMethodology\n3.1\nStudy site and Datasets\nThe study area, shown in Fig. 1, encompasses the Gesäuse National Park in Styria, Austria,\nincluding the national park itself, the Natura 2000 protected area Ennstaler Alpen/Gesäuse and\nthe Johnsbachtal catchment, located south of the protected site. This area is also a site in the\nEuropean Long-Term Ecosystem Research (eLTER) network [36]. The region features extensive\nforests, dynamic waterways, alpine meadows, and rocky landscapes [37]. Forest management is\ngenerally limited to necessary safety logging around infrastructure and some assisted transformation\nto a more natural tree species composition by removing formerly planted spruces. Approximately\n70% of the forest within the national park is protected biotope forest, where natural processes,\nsuch as bark beetle infestations, are allowed to proceed without human intervention [38]. These\nmanagement regulations enable the occurrence of rare ecological dynamics not commonly found in\nother areas of Austria.\nFigure 1: Map of the study area\n6\n",
