Area.-Many map projections are designed to be equal-area, so that a coin \nof any size, for example, on one part of the map covers exactly the same area of \nthe actual Earth as the same coin on any other part of the map. Shapes, angles, \nand scale must be distorted on most parts of such a map, but there are usually \nsome parts of an equal-area map which are designed to retain these characteris-\ntics correctly, or very nearly so. Less common terms used for equal-area projec-\ntions are equivalent, homolographic, or homalographic (from the-Greek-homalos----------\nor homos (\"same\") and graphos (\"write\")); authalic (from the Greek autos (\"same\") \nand ailos (\"area\")), and equiareal. \n2. Shape.-Many of the most common and most important projections are \nconformal or orthomorphic (from the Greek orthos or \"straight\" and morphe or \n\"shape\"), in that normally the relative local angles about every point on the map \nare shown correctly. (On a conformal map of the entire Earth there are usually \none or more \"singular\" points at which local angles are still distorted.) Although a \nlarge area must still be shown distorted in shape, its small features are shaped \nessentially correctly. Conformality applies on a point or infinitesimal basis, whereas \nan equal-area map projection shows areas correctly on a finite, in fact mapwide \nbasis. An important result of conformality is that the local scale in every direction \naround any one point is constant. Because local angles are correct, meridians \nintersect parallels at right (90°) angles on a conformal projection, just as they do on \nthe Earth. Areas are generally enlarged or reduced throughout the map, but they \nare correct along certain lines, depending on the projection. Nearly all large-scale \nmaps of the Geological Survey and other mapping agencies throughout the world \nare now prepared on a conformal projection. No map can be both equal-area and \nconformal. \nWhile some have used the term aphylactic for all projections which are neither \nequal-area nor conformal (Lee, 1944), other terms have commonly been used to \ndescribe special characteristics: \n3. Scale.-No map projection shows scale correctly throughout the map, but \nthere are usually one or more lines on the map along which the scale remains true. \nBy choosing the locations of these lines properly, the scale errors elsewhere may \nbe minimized, although some errors may still be large, depending on the size of \nthe area being mapped and the projection. Some projections show true scale \nbetween one or two points and every other point on the map, or along every \nmeridian. They are called equidistant projections. \n4. Direction.-While conformal maps give the relative local directions cor-\nrectly at any given point, there is one frequently used group of map projections, \ncalled azimuthal (or zenithal), on which the directions or azimuths of all points on \nthe map are shown correctly with respect to the center. One of these projections \nis also equal-area, another is conformal, and another is equidistant. There are also \nprojections on which directions from two points are correct, or on which direc-\ntions from all points to one or two selected points are correct, but these are rarely \nused. \n5. Special characteristics.-Several map projections provide special characteris-\ntics that no other projection provides. On the Mercator projection, all rhumb \nlines, or lines of constant direction, are shown as straight lines. On the Gnomonic \nprojection, all great circle paths-the shortest routes between points on a sphere-\nare shown as straight lines. On the Stereographic, all small circles, as well as \ngreat circles, are shown as circles on the map. Some newer projections are spe-\ncially designed for satellite mapping. Less useful but mathematically intriguing \nprojections have been designed to fit the sphere conformally into a square, an \nellipse, a triangle, or some other geometric figure. \n6. Method of construction.-ln the days before ready access to computers and \nplotters, ease of construction was of greater importance. With the advent of \ncomputers and even pocket calculators, very complicated formulas can be handled \nalmost as routinely as simple projections in the past. \n",

In 1884, the International Meridian Conference, meeting \nin Washington, agreed to adopt the \"meridian passing through the center of the \ntransit instrument at the Observatory of Greenwich as the initial meridian for \nlongitude,\" resolving that \"from this meridian longitude shall be counted in two \ndirections up to 180 degrees, east longitude being plus and west longitude minus\" \n(Brown, 1949, p. 283, 297). \nThe choice of the prime meridian is arbitrary and may be stated in simple \nterms. The accurate measurement of the difference in longitude at sea between \ntwo points, however, was unattainable for centuries, even with a precision suffi-\ncient for the times. When extensive transatlantic exploration from Europe began \nwith the voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the inability to measure \neast-west distance led to numerous shipwrecks with substantial loss of lives and \nwealth. Seafaring nations beginning with Spain offered sizable rewards for the \ninvention of satisfactory methods for measuring longitude. It finally became evi-\ndent that a portable, dependable clock was needed, so that the height of the Sun \nor stars could be related to the time in order to determine longitude. The study of \nthe pendulum by Galileo, the invention of the pendulum clock by Christian Huygens \nin 1656, and Robert Hooke's studies of the use of springs in watches in the 1660's \nprovided the basic instrument, but it was not until John Harrison of England \nresponded to his country's substantial reward posted in 1714 that the problem \nwas solved. For five decades, Harrison devised successively more reliable ver-\nsions of a marine chronometer, which were tested at sea and gradually accepted \nby the Board of Longitude in painstaking steps from 1765 to 1773. Final compensa-\ntion required intervention by the King and Parliament (Brown, 1949, p. 208-240; \nQuill, 1966). \nThus a major obstacle to accurate mapping was overcome.

SCALE VARIATION AND ANGULAR DISTORTION \nSince no map projection maintains correct scale throughout, it is important to \ndetermine the extent to which it varies on a map. On a world map, qualitative \ndistortion is evident to an eye familiar with maps, after noting the extent to which \nlandmasses are improperly sized or out of shape, and the extent to which meridi-\nans and parallels do not intersect at right angles, or are not spaced uniformly \nalong a given meridian or given parallel. On maps of countries or even of continents, \ndistortion may not be evident to the eye, but it becomes apparent upon careful \nmeasurement and analysis. \nTISSOT'S INDICA TRIX \nIn 1859 and 1881, Nicolas Auguste Tissot published a classic analysis of the \ndistortion which occurs on a map projection (Tissot, 1881; Adams, 1919, p. 153-163; \nMaling, 1973, p. 64-67). The intersection of any two lines on the Earth is repre-\nsented on the flat map with an intersection at the same or a different angle. At \nalmost every point on the Earth, there is a right angle intersection of two lines in \nsome direction (not necessarily a meridian and a parallel) which are also shown at \nright angles on the map. All the other intersections at that point on the Earth will \nnot intersect at the same angle on the map, unless the map is conformal, at least \nat that point. The greatest deviation from the correct angle is called w, the \nmaximum angular deformation. For a conformal map, w is zero. (In some texts, 2w \nis used rather than w.) \nTissot showed this relationship graphically with a special ellipse of distortion \ncalled an indicatrix. An infinitely small circle on the Earth projects as an infinitely \nsmall, but perfect, ellipse on any map projection. If the projection is conformal, \nthe ellipse is a circle, an ellipse of zero eccentricity. Otherwise, the ellipse has a \nmajor axis and minor axis which are directly related to the scale distortion and to \nthe maximum angular deformation. \nIn figure 3, the left-hand drawing shows a circle representing the infinitely \nsmall circular element, crossed by a meridian >-. and parallel <!> on the Earth. The \nright-hand drawing shows this same element as it may appear on a typical map \nprojection. For general purposes, the map is assumed to be neither conformal nor \nequal-area. The meridian and parallel may no longer intersect at right angles, but \n(AJ \n(a) \nFIGURE 3.-Tissot's Indicatrix. An infinitely small circle on the Earth (A) appears as an ellipse \non a typical map (B). On a conformal map, (B) is a circle of the same or of a different size. \n",

      "text": "32 \nMAP PROJECTIONS-A WORKING MANUAL \nEquation (5-8b) is generally preferable to (5-8) or (5-8a) for the reasons stated \nafter equation (5-4b). \nThese are general formulas for the oblique transformation. (For azimuthal pro-\njections, 13 may always be taken as zero. Other values of 13 merely have the effect \nof rotating the X and Y axes without changing the projection.) \nThe inverse forms of these equations are similar in appearance. To find the \ngeographic coordinates in terms of the transformed coordinates, \nor \nor \nsin 4> =sin a sin 4>' + cos a cos 4>' cos (X.'- 13) \nsin (X. -\nX.0) =cos 4>' sin (X.' - 13)/cos 4> \ncos (X. -\nX-0) = [sin a cos 4>' cos (X.' -\n13) - cos a sin 4>']/cos 4> \n(5-9) \n(5-10) \n(5-10a) \ntan (X. -\nX.0) = cos 4>' sin (X.' - 13)/[sin a cos 4>' cos (X.' -\n13) - cos a sin 4>'] (5-10b) \nwith equation (5-10b) usually preferable to (5-10) and (5-10a) for the same \nreasons as those given for (5-4b). \nIf a = 0, the formulas simplify considerably for the transverse or equatorial \naspects. It is then more convenient to have central meridian X.0 coincide with the \nequator of the basic projection rather than with its meridian 13. This may be \naccomplished by replacing (X. -\nX.0) with (X. -\nX.0 -\n90°) and simplifying. \nIf 13 = 0, so that the true North Pole is placed at (X.' = 0, 4>' = 0): \nsin 4>' = -cos 4> sin (X. -\nX.0) \ncos X.' =sin <f>/[1 - cos2 4> sin2(X. -\nX-0)]112 \nor \ntan X.' = - cos (X. -\nX-0)/tan 4> \nIf 13 = 90°, placing the true North Pole at (X.' = 90°, 4>' = 0): \nsin 4>' = - cos 4> sin (X. -\nX.0 ) \ncos X.' =cos 4> cos (X. -\nX-0)/[1 - cos2 4> sin2 (X. -\nX-0)]112 \nor \ntan X.' =tan <f>/cos (X. -\nX-0) \nThe inverse equations (5-9) through (5-10b) may be similarly altered. \n(5-11) \n(5-12) \n(5-12a) \n(5-13) \n(5-14) \n(5-14a) \nAs stated earlier, these formulas may be directly incorporated into the formu-\nlas for the rectangular coordinates x and y of the basic map projection for a direct \ncomputer or calculator output. If only one or two projections are involved in a \npackage, this may be more efficient. For such transformations of several projec-\ntions in one software package, it is often easier to calculate the transverse or \noblique projection coordinates by first calculating 4>' and X.' for each point to be \nplotted (using a general subroutine) and then calculating the rectangular coordi-\nnates by inserting 4>' and X.' into the basic projection formulas. In still other cases, \na graphical method has been used. \nWhile these formulas, or their equivalents, will be incorporated into the formu-\nlas given later for individual oblique and transverse projections, the concept \nshould help interrelate the various aspects or types of centers of a given projec-\ntion. The extension of these concepts to the ellipsoid is much more involved tech-\nnically and in some cases requires approximation. General discussion of this is \nomitted here. \n",

This kind of route is \ncalled a loxodrome or rhumb line and is usually longer than the great circle path \n(which is the shortest possible route on the sphere).
